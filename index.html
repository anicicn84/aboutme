        <h4>Hi, I am Nikola Anicic. Pleased to meet you.</h4>
        <h3>About me: </h3>
        <h5>
          Born in 1990. in Serbia, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ivanjica,+Serbia/@43.5836966,20.2186593,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4757bd9cf15a1047:0x2752d27d277e300b!8m2!3d43.5826282!4d20.2301407">Ivanjica</a> - a small town in the west, famous for raspberries and potatoes. <br>
          My mom's a teacher in an elementary school, dad is a surveyor and I have one brother who works in the army. <br>
          I was always passionate about physics, math, and science, but I also loved to play sports. <br>
          Sports I liked when I was younger were football and basketball. Later on at the university, I have spent 6 years training krav maga, Muay Thai and MMA.
          After I have dislocated my shoulder twice I have stopped doing such sports and occasionally I go to the gym to stay in shape and to keep my shoulder strong. 
          Gym helps a lot to get brain rest, to focus better afterwards and not to fully get into sedentary lifestyle. <br>
          As for my hobbies, I like binging TV series, traveling (like you can see on my picture on the left), reading my kindle, stuff like self-help books, management, politics and a wide variety of things, except novels and Sci-Fi. I like to read practical books based on the experiences of other people. <br>
          I have a wife and no kids at the moment, but I'd like to have 3 kids. <br>
        </h5>
        <h3>Now on the more professional side... </h3>
        <p>I am a software engineer living and working in Switzerland. In Serbia, I have finished high school, Bachelor's and Master's degree in Electronics and Computer science at the University of Belgrade, <a href="https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/en#gsc.tab=0">School of Electrical Engineering.</a></p>
        <p>I have moved to Switzerland in November 2017. I have 7+ years of experience, mostly in <strong><i>C++</i></strong>, but I love working in <strong><i></i>Rust</i></strong>, <strong><i></i>JavaScript</i></strong>, <strong><i></i>TypeScript</i></strong>, <strong><i></i>React</i></strong>, <strong><i></i>NodeJS</i></strong>, <strong><i></i>Sass</i></strong>, and <strong><i></i>C#</i></strong> occasionally.</p>
        <p>This is the place where you can learn more about me, see my skills and my experience, and how to reach out.</p>
