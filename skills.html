      <h1><u>Portfolio</u></h1>
      <p>
        I've been, mostly, programming in C++ throughout my career. Some people consider C++ to be one of the hardest languages to learn due to the fact that C++ developers need to understand memory and do cleanups on their own. <br>
Also, pretty much all of the other languages are written in C, or C++, nowadays maybe even Rust. Anyhow, coming from the electronics background I have come from the embedded and chips world into the world of programming. Over time, I was more and more interested to get to the higher applicative software, instead of staying at a more low level (embedded and drivers). For me, coding should include clean and readable code, OOP, and functional principles, depending on the need, usage of design patterns when needed, and good knowledge of algorithms and data structures. <br>
Every once in a while I take some leetcode, codewars, or algoexpert challenge and try to solve it. In the beginning, it was mainly in C++, later on, I have used Python for it, then Rust and JavaScript. <br>
It is fun, good to stay in a shape, and sometimes I might stumble upon the new data structures, like in Rust - BHashMaps for example. "New" - meaning not standard ones, could be improved ones, by a bit.

        <h2><u>Interests</u></h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>As for my interests, I'd like to work in Rust more, I found it quite complicated to learn, but also quite cool and with some great features - it is not the most beloved language on the Stack Overflow polls for 4-5 years in a row by chance. People love it, but not a lot of people mastered it. </li>
            <li>JavaScript, TypeScript, NodeJS, React, cloud, microservices, also HTMS & CSS/SASS - these are other things and areas of my great interest. The Web runs the world and a lot of things have evolved pretty quickly in the Web. Only a few years ago React and Angular didn't exist, only a few years ago jQuerry and PHP ruled the world. This is a quite fast-moving domain, frontend, and backend, everything Web related. Systems Design emerges here as a new pretty cool and interesting to me area. When millions of users want to access specific websites and resources then some distributed and scaling magic (horizontal and vertical) need to be done in order to provide the best user experience. CDNs, Load balancers, Consistent Hashing, Map-Reduce, Bloom filters, caching, DB sharding, relational vs non-relational DBs - everything of it is of great interest to me. </li>
            <li>Blockchain and Web3, Solitidy, Ethereum and Cardano, etc. </li>
            <li>As for the sectors - I'd like to learn more about the financial sector, crypto and crypto trading, marketing, sales, and eCommerce. These are the areas I would be thrilled to work in, if the chance occurs. </li>
          </ul>
